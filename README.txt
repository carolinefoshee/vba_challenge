
I did not work with any other students on this assignment. 

Outside sources I used: 
- Declaring a range object: https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/range-object.html 
- How to obtain min and max: https://officetuts.net/excel/vba/find-the-maximum-and-minimum-value-in-the-range-in-vba/
- How to format something as a percent: https://excelchamps.com/vba/functions/formatpercent/#:~:text=The%20VBA%20FORMATPERCENT%20function%20is,as%20a%20string%20data%20type.

Note: Running the code with that large of an Excel file made my computer crash. So the min/max/greatest volume data is only for rows 1 to 10000. Also, GitHub would not let me upload the large file of code. So I have attached the alphabetical_testing file with the VBA code included.
